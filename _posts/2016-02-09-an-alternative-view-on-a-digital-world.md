​Today photography has become so readily available to all of humanity. It is because of this that having a unique style is not only vital to​ the progression of the medium but also to differentiate oneself from the competition. This is why I use film and other aged historic processes. Bringing back to life the qualities and unique aspects of the permanence of the medium, in an age where one can simply edit an image after capture. This is what sets my work apart from most, my images are an exact replication of the work put into the capture, rather than the edit of reality.
